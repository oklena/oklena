# About Me

Hi! I am Elena, a data scientist with a background in aerospace. Coding always was a part of my education and job. I have a degree in structural engineering. As a student, I used to code using Matlab to solve all the structural problems. As a stress engineer, I was coding using VBA. Worked with large datasets that required different manipulations, often done with a custom script or a code. Recently, graduated from Flatiron Data Science bootcamp. 

Experienced with Python, Pandas, NumPy and love creating good looking graphs.
